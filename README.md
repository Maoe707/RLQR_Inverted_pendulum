# Robust linear quadratic regulator applied to an inverted pendulum

## Abstract

The inverted pendulum has unstable dynamic char-acteristics  and  its  operating  principle  analogous  to  other  morecomplex real-time systems, making it one of the classic problemsused  for  testing  control  techniques.  In  this  paper,  we  addressthe  main  inverted  pendulum  problems:  pendulum-stabilization,tracking, and catching swing-up control. We show how recursivecontrol  and  filtering  techniques  on  robust  versions  improve  thesystem  performance.  The  algorithms  used  are  motivated  by  thefact that stochastic problems can be solved through deterministicarguments.  Therefore,  it  is  possible  to  obtain  the  best  perfor-mance even in the case with the worst influence of uncertainties.Experimental  results  of  the  proposed  control  schemes  based  onrobust linear quadratic regulator and robust Kalman filter show aguarantee of robust stability and performance despite parametricuncertainties,  disturbances,  and  noise  effects.Index  Termsâ€”Discrete-time  systems,  robust  control,  robustfiltering,  mechatronics  systems.
